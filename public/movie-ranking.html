<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>

<h3>The Nature of Love</h3>
<p>
Writer-director Monia Chokri’s “The Nature of Love,” is a two-hour foray into longing, self-searching, and passion. Sophia (a magnetic Magalie Lépine Blondeau), is a philosophy professor who is stably, but stagnantly in-like with her wealthy partner of 10 years, Xavier (Francis-William Rhéaume). When they decide to rehab their old summer chateau, Sophie goes to meet the contractor, Sylvain (a charismatic, sultry Pierre-Yves Cardinal), and finds the sooty wick of her desire reignited. The two strike up a feverish, insatiable love affair that leaves Sophia second guessing the principles of love and comfort, and excitedly toeing the line of making her current life a thing of the past.

<h3>Green Border</h3>
<p>
   A searing drama about a European refugee crisis that resonates with similar crises in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and yes, America’s southwestern border, Agnieszka Holland’s “Green Border” strikes me as the best and most important film to be released in the U.S. so far this year. That judgment is due not only to the fraught importance of the film’s subject but also to the extraordinary artistry of its making. When I first saw it at last fall’s New York Film Festival, I left the theater literally shaken – not only by the compelling story I’d just witnessed but also by the moment-by-moment power of Holland’s filmmaking.

<h3>The Human Surge 3</h3>
<p>
   We film lovers perpetually bang the drum about how cinema enables us to experience life from perspectives outside of our own. The medium reveals the world and those who inhabit it with singular precision as it observes who we are with a magnifying glass. But while plenty of titles accomplish this effect, none have done it quite like “The Human Surge 3,” the latest experimental work from Argentine visionary Eduardo Williams.
